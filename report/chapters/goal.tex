\section{Goal and Importance}
The goal of this project is to predict the next month's single-family house prices for a specific city in Canada using a deep learning model. The project is crucial because accurate house price predictions can help potential buyers, sellers, and policymakers make informed decisions. It also assists real estate investors in mitigating risks and optimizing investments by analyzing the factors influencing market trends.

The project's importance lies in its potential to provide valuable insights into the real estate market dynamics, enabling stakeholders to anticipate price fluctuations and make strategic decisions. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, we aim to enhance the accuracy and reliability of house price predictions, contributing to a more efficient and transparent real estate market.

Moreover, the project's focus on deep learning models, such as Autoencoder-LSTM, showcases the power of combining feature extraction and temporal modeling for time-series forecasting. By integrating these cutting-edge technologies, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning in capturing complex patterns and dependencies in real estate data, paving the way for more sophisticated predictive analytics in the housing market.
